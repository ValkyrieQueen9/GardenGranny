# GardenGranny
Help Granny to defend her garden from mutated pests using her trusty shovel, keep grannyâ€™s crops alive!!

The game takes place in an old woman's garden where pests have mutated and viciously attacked her crops. You play as the granny who must defend her crops from the attacking mutant pests. The game is a 2D pixelated art style with increasing difficulty as the waves of pests continue!

The game was made during a Skills Bootcamp course in Commercial Game Development and is my first game made with Unity Engine and C#.
